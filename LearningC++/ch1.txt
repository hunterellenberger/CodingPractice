Classes contain members of two types data and functions
  - An instance of a class is known as an object
  - Members may be public or private
  - Public members are accessible by any part of the code
  - Private members are accessable only within the class
  - Protected members are accessable in inherited classes

Inheritence and Polymorphism
  - A class may have subclasses based on it
  - A subclass may inherit members from the superclass
  - Polymorphism describes how a function may be differently implemented within its superclass than its subclasses
